def two_layer_convnet(X, model, y=None, reg=0.0):
  """
  Compute the loss and gradient for a simple two-layer ConvNet. The architecture
  is conv-relu-pool-affine-softmax, where the conv layer uses stride-1 "same"
  convolutions to preserve the input size; the pool layer uses non-overlapping
  2x2 pooling regions. We use L2 regularization on both the convolutional layer
  weights and the affine layer weights.

  Inputs:
  - X: Input data, of shape (N, C, H, W)
  - model: Dictionary mapping parameter names to parameters. A two-layer Convnet
    expects the model to have the following parameters:
    - W1, b1: Weights and biases for the convolutional layer
    - W2, b2: Weights and biases for the affine layer
  - y: Vector of labels of shape (N,). y[i] gives the label for the point X[i].
  - reg: Regularization strength.

  Returns:
  If y is None, then returns:
  - scores: Matrix of scores, where scores[i, c] is the classification score for
    the ith input and class c.

  If y is not None, then returns a tuple of:
  - loss: Scalar value giving the loss.
  - grads: Dictionary with the same keys as model, mapping parameter names to
    their gradients.
