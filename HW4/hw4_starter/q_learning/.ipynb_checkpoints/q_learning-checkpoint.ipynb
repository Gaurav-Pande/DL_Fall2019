    "## Part 1: Setup Q-Learning with Linear Function Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Q-networks using (Deep) Q-learning involves a lot of moving parts. However, for this assignment, the scaffolding for the first 3 points listed below is provided in full and you must only complete point 4. You may skip to point 4 if you only care about the implementation required for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environments**: We will use the standardized OpenAI Gym framework for environment API calls (read through http://gym.openai.com/docs/ if you want to know more details about this interface). Specifically, we will use a custom Test environment defined in `utils/test_env.py` for initial sanity checks and then Gym-Atari environments later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploration**: In order to train any RL model, we require experience or \"data\" gathered from interacting with the environment by taking actions. What policy should we use to collect this experience? Given a Q-network, one may be tempted to define a greedy policy which always picks the highest valued action at every state. However, this strategy will in most cases not work since we may get stuck in a local minima and never explore new states in the environment which may lead to a better reward. Hence, for the purpose of gathering experience (or \"data\") from the environment, it is useful to follow a policy that deviates from the greedy policy slightly in order to explore new states. A common strategy used in RL is to follow an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy which with probability $0 < \\epsilon < 1$ picks a random action instead of the action provided by the greedy policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Replay Buffers**: Data gathered from a single trajectory of states and actions in the environment provides us with a batch of highly correlated (non IID) data, which leads to high variance in gradient updates and convergence. In order to ameliorate this, replay buffers are used to gather a set of transitions i.e. (state, action, reward, next state) tuples, by executing multiple trajectories in the environment. Now, for updating the Q-Network, we will first wait to fill up our replay buffer with a sufficiently large number of transitions over multiple different trajectories, and then randomly sample a batch of transitions to compute loss and update the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Q-Learning network, loss and update**: Finally, we come to the part of Q-learning that we will implement for this assignment -- the Q-network, loss function and update. In particular, we will implement a variant of Q-Learning called \"Double Q-Learning\", where we will maintain two Q networks -- the first Q network is used to pick actions and the second \"target\" Q network is used to compute Q-values for the picked actions. Here is some referance material on the same - [Blog 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/double-q-learning-the-easy-way-a924c4085ec3), [Blog 2](https://medium.com/@ameetsd97/deep-double-q-learning-why-you-should-use-it-bedf660d5295), but we will not need to get into the details of Double Q-learning for this assignment. Now, let's walk through the steps required to implement this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Linear Q-Network**: In `linear_qnet.py`, define the initialization and forward pass of a Q-network with a single linear layer which takes the state as input and outputs the Q-values for all actions.\n",
    "    - **Setting up Q-Learning**: In `core/dqn_train.py`, complete the functions `process_state`, `forward_loss` and `update_step` and `update_target_params`. The loss function for our Q-Networks is defined for a single transition tuple of (state, action, reward, next state) as follows. $Q(s_t, a_t)$ refers to the state-action values computed by our first Q-network at the current state and and for the current actions, $Q_{target}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ refers to the state-action values for the next state and all possible future actions computed by the target Q-Network\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Q_{sample}(s_t) &= r_t \\textrm{ if done} \\hspace{10cm}\\\\\n",
    "    &= r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a_{t+1}} Q_{target}\\left(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}\\right) \\textrm{ otherwise}\\\\\n",
    "    \\textrm{Loss} &= \\left( Q_{sample}(s_t) - Q(s_t, a_t) \\right) ^2\n",
