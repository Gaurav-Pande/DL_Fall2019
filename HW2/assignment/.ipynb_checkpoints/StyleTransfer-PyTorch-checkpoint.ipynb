    "# Style Transfer (20 Points)\n",

    "Another task closely related to image gradient is style transfer. This has become a cool application in deep learning with computer vision. In this notebook we will study and implement the style transfer technique from:\n",

    "* [\"Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks\" (Gatys et al., CVPR 2015)](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to take two images (a content image and a style image), and produce a new image that reflects the content of one but the artistic \"style\" of the other. We will do this by first formulating a loss function that matches the content and style of each respective image in the feature space of a deep network, and then performing gradient descent on the pixels of the image itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will also use [SqueezeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360) as our feature extractor which can easily work on a CPU machine. Similarly, if computational resources are not any problem for you, you are encouraged to try a larger network, which may give you benefits in the visual output in this homework. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Note for grading**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total credits for this notebook are 20 points. For each of the loss function, **you will need to pass the unit test to receive full credits, otherwise it will be 0.** For the final output you will be expected to generate the images similar to the output to receive the full credits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Although we will not run your notebook in grading, you still need to **submit the notebook with all the outputs you generated**. Sometimes it will inform us if we get any inconsitent results with respect to yours. \n",

We can then use this hybrid loss function to perform gradient descent **not on the parameters** of the model, but instead **on the pixel values** of our original image.\n",

    "Let's first write the content loss function. Content loss measures how much the feature map of the generated image differs from the feature map of the source image. We only care about the content representation of one layer of the network (say, layer $\\ell$), that has feature maps $A^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times C_\\ell \\times H_\\ell \\times W_\\ell}$. $C_\\ell$ is the number of filters/channels in layer $\\ell$, $H_\\ell$ and $W_\\ell$ are the height and width. We will work with reshaped versions of these feature maps that combine all spatial positions into one dimension. Let $F^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_\\ell \\times M_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the current image and $P^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_\\ell \\times M_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the content source image where $M_\\ell=H_\\ell\\times W_\\ell$ is the number of elements in each feature map.
